# Claude Integration Migration Summary

## Overview

The Gemini CLI has been successfully migrated to support both Gemini and Claude as AI providers, giving users the flexibility to choose their preferred LLM.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Core Architecture

- **New Claude Client**: Created `packages/core/src/claude/claudeClient.ts` implementing the `ContentGenerator` interface
- **Enhanced ContentGenerator**: Updated `packages/core/src/core/contentGenerator.ts` to support provider selection
- **Provider Configuration**: Added provider support throughout the configuration system

### 2. Authentication & Configuration

- **New AuthType**: Added `USE_CLAUDE` to the `AuthType` enum
- **Provider Parameter**: Added `provider` field to configuration interfaces
- **Environment Variables**: Support for `CLAUDE_API_KEY` and `AI_PROVIDER` environment variables

### 3. CLI Integration

- **Command Line Flag**: Added `--provider` flag to select between 'gemini' and 'claude'
- **Settings Support**: Provider can be configured via settings file
- **Argument Parsing**: Enhanced yargs configuration to handle provider selection

### 4. Model Support

- **Claude Models**: Added Claude model constants in `packages/core/src/config/models.ts`
- **Model Mapping**: Proper mapping between Claude and Gemini model formats

### 5. Documentation

- **Claude Guide**: Created comprehensive `docs/claude.md` with setup instructions
- **README Updates**: Updated main README to mention Claude support

## Usage

### Command Line

```bash
# Use Claude as provider
gemini --provider claude "Your prompt here"

# Use Gemini (default)
gemini --provider gemini "Your prompt here"
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Set Claude API key
export CLAUDE_API_KEY="your-api-key"

# Set default provider
export AI_PROVIDER="claude"
```

### Configuration File

```json
{
  "provider": "claude",
  "claudeApiKey": "your-api-key"
}
```

## Technical Details

### Dependencies Added

- `@anthropic-ai/sdk`: Anthropic's official SDK for Claude API integration

### Response Mapping

The Claude client includes sophisticated response mapping to ensure compatibility with the existing Gemini-centric codebase:

- Content types conversion
- Function call handling
- Token counting approximation
- Error handling and retry logic

### Build Status

✅ All packages build successfully
✅ TypeScript compilation passes
✅ Dependencies properly installed
✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Migration Benefits

1. **Provider Choice**: Users can now choose between Gemini and Claude
2. **Fallback Options**: If one provider has issues, users can switch to another
3. **Cost Optimization**: Users can select the most cost-effective provider for their needs
4. **Feature Comparison**: Users can compare outputs from different models

## Next Steps

- Runtime testing with actual API keys
- Performance benchmarking between providers
- Additional provider integrations (OpenAI, etc.) following the same pattern
- Enhanced error handling and retry logic
